## CatsAndBoats Contributor Guide

Welcome to CatsAndBoats! We appreciate your contributions to our projects. To ensure a smooth collaboration with upstream developers, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Communicate Intentions**
Before engaging in long coding sessions, discuss your intentions with the team. For submissions going upstream, consult with Xaver. If the submission is staying within CatsEye, discuss with admins (Carver, Hax, Neckbeard).

2. **Modular Submissions**
Avoid submitting massive pull requests. Separate submissions into easily digestible elements, such as core systems code and data entry aspects. This makes the review process more manageable.

3. **Professional Communication**
Refrain from becoming combative in pull request comments. For extensive discussions, engage LSB in the Private Servers discord. Keep pull request comments clean and professional to foster a positive and constructive atmosphere.

4. **Representing the Organization**
Remember that you represent CatsAndBoats. Uphold our reputation by maintaining a positive image. Avoid suggestive imagery or text in public-facing profiles. A positive standing in the community is crucial for collaboration.

5. **Provide Detailed Evidence**
When submitting pull requests, provide ample relevant evidence to support your changes. Upstream is unlikely to accept code consisting entirely of guessed data. Detailed documentation and explanations enhance the chances of your contribution being accepted.

6. **Readable Code**
Write code in an easily readable manner. Ensure that a layman can understand and follow your code. Use comments wherever possible to explain complex sections. Additionally, add TODOs in sections that may need to be revisited later as a follow-up exercise.
